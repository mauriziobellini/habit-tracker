## Notes for Reviewer

**How to complete a habit (required for testing):**  
Press and **hold** a habit circle for about 2 seconds. A progress ring fills around the circle; when it completes, you feel haptic feedback and the task is marked done. A short tap opens the context menu (Stats, Edit, Remove) instead of completing.

**First launch:**  
New users see an onboarding flow that teaches the tap-and-hold gesture and prompts them to create their first habit. You can tap "Skip" to go straight to the task list.

**Architecture:**  
The app is fully local. No account, no server, no analytics. All data is stored on-device with SwiftData. Notifications are local only (UserNotifications), no push service.
